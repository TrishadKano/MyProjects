# Web Security Attacks Project

1. Introduction
   
Web security attacks are increasingly prevalent in today's digital landscape. Websites 
and web applications, being integral to businesses, governments, and individuals, are 
prime targets for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes. 
These attacks can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and loss of reputation. 
Understanding common web security attack types, their techniques, and 
countermeasures is essential for improving the security posture of web applications.
This report will provide an overview of common web security attacks used to elevate 
privileges and exploit vulnerabilities, followed by testing recommendations using 
controlled environments. Lastly, a summary of potential countermeasures will be 
presented to mitigate these risks.
The goal of this Web Security Attacks Project is to enhance understanding of common 
web application vulnerabilities and attack techniques through hands-on simulation 
within a controlled environment. It aims to develop effective mitigation strategies and 
promote ethical hacking practices to protect against identified vulnerabilities. 
Ultimately, the project seeks to foster security awareness and encourage continuous 
learning among developers and stakeholders to improve the overall security posture of 
web applications.

# Overview

Web security attacks pose a significant threat to websites and web applications, often leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. This project focuses on:

Identifying and simulating common attack types such as SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.
Testing vulnerabilities in a controlled environment using Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA).
Proposing effective countermeasures to mitigate risks.

# Key Objectives

Understand and simulate common web attacks in a safe environment.
Enhance knowledge of tools like SQLMap, Nikto, and DVWA.
Promote secure coding practices and countermeasures for mitigating vulnerabilities.
Simulated Attacks

1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
Exploits vulnerable SQL queries to extract sensitive data or bypass authentication.
Example payload: ' OR 1=1 --
Tool: SQLMap.
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Injects malicious scripts into web pages, affecting end-users.
Example payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>.

4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Tricks authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
Example scenario: Transferring funds without user consent.

6. File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
Exploits inclusion of external files to execute unauthorized actions.
Types: Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI).

8. Directory Traversal
Manipulates file paths to access restricted directories.
Example payload: ../etc/passwd.

10. Command Injection
Executes arbitrary system commands through vulnerable input fields.
Example payload: ; rm -rf /.


# Tools and Environment


VirtualBox: Virtualization for isolated testing.

Ubuntu: Operating system for setting up the testing environment.

Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA): A deliberately insecure application for practicing attacks.

SQLMap: Detects and exploits SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

# REPORT:

 Out of all the SQLMap operations, a report can be created for either an attacker gathering information for malicious purposes about a particular web applications or security administrators to improve their security protocols.

 ![Picture25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86ada69d-f3be-40cd-b513-32924b55de6e)

 The summarized data of all the operations were summarized and stored under /host/trishad/.local/share/sqlmap/output/localhost . So to access the files we had to navigate to the directory to get the data summarized in text, so as to create a report and save it in a pdf form.

 ![Picture26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3efc3d0-8655-4026-8d05-e844e929819a)

# SQL INJECTION ATTACK ON THE DVWA: 

![Picture27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/819e4d83-cf07-4302-8637-0ffb744cfa8c)

The injection of ' OR 1=1 -- ' is a common and simple demonstration of SQL injection vulnerabilities, showing how an attacker can manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access or retrieve data they should not be able to access.
Attack 2: The command ' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT user, password FROM users# is an SQL injection attack payload, and it is designed to manipulate SQL queries in a way that allows the attacker to extract sensitive data from a database and retrieve all the users and their passwords. Since the passwords are hashed we can decrypt the passwords using SQLMap.


![Picture28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c267f3ec-b8c3-4759-a3ca-087385a8c471)

# DECRYPTION OF HASHED PASSWORDS :

![Picture30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1845700f-f046-44d9-9cd3-261536c9a216)

OUTPUT: The Hashed passwords were cracked using the Dictionary-Based Attack, which is another form of an attack.


XSS (REFLECTED) ATTACK ON DVWA: 
A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web applications, which are then executed in the context of the victim's browser.
How it Works?
For DVWA:
Original URL: http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=Trishad#

![Picture31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b830ab12-5837-4c79-a44c-eb2af9df7048)

CRAFTED LINK (MALICIOUS LINK):  http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=<script>alert(‘You + Have + Been+ Hacked’)<%2Fscript>#
The Malicious Script: <script>alert(‘You Have Been Hacked’)</script> was injected to original web page in creating another web page that is malicious, to deceive users into giving sensitive information.

![Picture33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10163e0d-d06a-4bcb-935d-072805e6c8d0)
OUTPUT: After Successfully Executing the attack, a new URL is created

# Testing Vulnerabilities

SQL Injection: Identify and exploit injection points using SQLMap.

python3 sqlmap.py -u "http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=5&Submit=Submit#" --batch --cookie="PHPSESSID=your_session_id; security=low"

XSS: Inject and execute malicious JavaScript on DVWA.

<script>alert('You Have Been Hacked')</script>

# Countermeasures

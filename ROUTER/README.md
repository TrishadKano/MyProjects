# Router Installation and Configuration

 # Introduction
The objective of this report is to document the installation and configuration process of a router in a network infrastructure environment. The router plays a critical role in facilitating network communication and ensuring connectivity between various devices. This report outlines the steps involved in setting up the router, analyzes the results of the configuration process and provides suggestions for future improvements.

# Installation and Configuration Process

1.Installing Ubuntu Server: 
https://ubuntu.com/download/server

2. Creating Network Adapters
. There were set up of two adapters for each virtual machine

Adapter 1: NAT

The first adapter is configured to use NAT (Network Address Translation). With NAT, the virtual machine shares the host's IP address and appears to external networks as if it's the host machine itself. This allows the virtual machine to access resources on external networks (like the internet) through the host machine's network connection. NAT is commonly used for outbound internet access in virtualized environments.

Adapter 2: Internal Network

The second adapter is configured to use an internal network. An internal network is a virtual network that exists only within the virtualization platform and is isolated from external networks and the host machine's network. Virtual machines connected to the same internal network can communicate with each other but cannot communicate with machines outside of the internal network or the host machine. Internal networks are often used for creating isolated environments for testing or experimentation purposes.


# Linux Router Setup

This repository contains a step-by-step guide for configuring a Linux machine as a router. The process includes setting up a DHCP server, configuring a firewall with iptables, enabling IP forwarding, and ensuring proper communication between client machines.

# Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- Configure a machine's hostname for identification.
- Set up and configure a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.
- Implement a firewall using iptables.
- Enable IP forwarding for packet routing.
- Test communication between client and server machines.

# Features
- Dynamic IP allocation using DHCP.
- Secure routing with iptables firewall rules.
- IP forwarding for seamless network communication.
- Static IP address configuration for persistent routing.
  
# Steps to Configure the Router

# Change Hostname

First step in setting up our router is to changer hostname of our machine so we can easily identify it, in our case “router”. This step is optional.

sudo hostnamectl set-hostname router

# Update the /etc/hosts file:
As well as editing hosts file using this command sudo nano /etc/hosts to launch an editor and rename second line 127.0.0.1 to router. After this we need to restart our machine so that it’s new name can appear.

# Configuring the DHCP Server
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows you to centralize your IP address management. Machines which are added to a network will issue a DHCP request asking any available DHCP server to provide it with configuration information including IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS server,
We need to update packages and install DHCP server using command below.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server

# Edit the dhcpd.conf file:

After successfully installing dhcp-server we need to make few changes in the dhcpd.conf file which we can find by navigating to this folder /etc/dhcp using this command cd /etc/dhcp and copy dhcpd.conf file to a backup file using this command sudo cp dhcpd.conf dhcpd.conf.backup  in case we make errors we can quickly look at backup file for reference as we are going to edit dhcpd.conf. 

cd /etc/dhcp
sudo cp dhcpd.conf dhcpd.conf.backup
sudo nano dhcpd.conf

# Add the following configuration:

ddns-update-style none;

option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;

default-lease-time 600;

max-lease-time 7200;

authoritative;

subnet 20.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 
{
   
    range 20.0.0.5 20.0.0.10;
    
    
    option routers 20.0.0.1;
    
}

# Update the /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server file to set the interface:

sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server

# Configuring the Firewall with iptables
Enable the firewall and allow DHCP communication:

sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 67/udp

![Picture9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cb5cfe0-e798-4d34-bbf9-608fd93874b5)

# Apply firewall rules:

sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP

sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP

sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -j MASQUERADE

sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth2 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Enable IP Forwarding

IP Forwarding using net.ipv4.ip_forward
We need to edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file using # sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf, to make sure the new setting survives a reboot.
so we need to uncomment the line # net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0 and change its value from net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0 to net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

![Picture11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7e30ec-9ce7-4cb7-8ba4-01f7eb8512b8)
# Uncomment and modify the line:

net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
# Assign Static IP to Interface

Give the interface enp0s8 IP address that matches the router option defined in the dhcpd.conf file and add the route via the IP address given to the interface enp0s8 using commands.

sudo ifconfig enp0s8 20.0.0.1

sudo ip route add 20.0.0.0/24 via 20.0.0.1

# Restart Services
Restart the network manager and DHCP server:

sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
![Picture13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1668e44-7bff-49da-a570-db7879723d87)


Now that DHCP server is running we can spin up client and server machines to test our dhcp configuration settings as well as sending packets. We need to connect the client machines on the same network as the router.
DHCP server is working as intended as it was able to give client machines IP addresses 20.0.0.5, and 20.0.0.6 respectively.
We can test the communication between the clients

![Picture14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5acdb245-53a5-408b-ad9c-708139c3ab46)


# Testing the Setup
- Spin up client machines on the same network.
- Verify that the DHCP server assigns IP addresses (e.g., 20.0.0.5 and 20.0.0.6).
- Test communication between clients and the router using tools like ping.

# Suggestions for Improvement


When embarking on a router project using VirtualBox and Ubuntu Server, there are key suggestions for improvement to enhance the project's success. Firstly, it is crucial to meticulously plan the network setup, including defining clear objectives, documenting configurations, and ensuring a detailed network diagram. This planning phase helps in avoiding common pitfalls and streamlining the implementation process. Additionally, understanding network protocols, subnetting, and firewall configurations is essential for a robust and secure router setup.
Secondly, implementing security measures is paramount to safeguard the router and connected devices. This includes setting up firewall rules, access control lists, and encryption to protect against unauthorized access and potential security threats. Regularly testing and validating the router's functionality, including routing, network segmentation, and connectivity, is vital to ensure that it meets the project's objectives and operates smoothly.
Lastly, continuous monitoring and improvement are key aspects of maintaining an efficient router project. Regularly monitoring the router's performance, security, and functionality allows for timely adjustments and optimizations. Collaboration with team members, documenting changes, and staying updated on networking technologies and best practices contribute to the long-term success of the router project. By following these suggestions, individuals can enhance their router project using VirtualBox and Ubuntu Server for a more effective and reliable network setup.

# Conclusion

With this setup, your Linux machine functions as a router with DHCP capabilities, a secure firewall, and IP forwarding for seamless client communication.

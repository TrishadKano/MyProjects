Router Configuration Project

Description: Configures a Linux-based router to manage network traffic using tools like DHCP, iptables, and IP forwarding.

Key Features:

- DHCP server setup for dynamic IP allocation.
- Firewall rules for network security.
- IP forwarding to route traffic effectively.
- Location: /Router_Project.
- Web Security Attacks Simulation

Description: Simulates common web vulnerabilities and attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF) in a controlled environment using DVWA.

Key Features:
Tools: SQLMap, Nikto, and manual testing.
Vulnerability assessment and exploitation.
Countermeasures and mitigation strategies.
Location: /Web_Security_Attacks_Project.

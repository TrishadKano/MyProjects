# Cybersecurity Projects
   
Router Configuration Project

Description: Configures a Linux-based router to manage network traffic using tools like DHCP, iptables, and IP forwarding.
Key Features:
DHCP server setup for dynamic IP allocation.
Firewall rules for network security.
IP forwarding to route traffic effectively.

Web Security Attacks Simulation

Description: Simulates common web vulnerabilities and attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF) in a controlled environment using DVWA.
Key Features:
Tools: SQLMap, Nikto, and manual testing.
Vulnerability assessment and exploitation.
Countermeasures and mitigation strategies.



# Machine Learning Projects
   
BreastCancer Detection

Description: The Projects Features Detection of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning. It has been tested that while there exists several machine learning models,Support Vector Machine or SVM in short is reported to have highest accuracy of (approximately 97%) in detecting breast cancer.


# Usage

Navigate to the respective project directories for detailed documentation and instructions.
Each project includes its own README.md with setup, dependencies, and usage guidelines.
